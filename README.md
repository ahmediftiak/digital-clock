# digital-clock
In this lab, we will be implementing seven-segment numerical displays and various types of digital Integrated circuits (ICs), counters, and gates to build a 12-hour or 24 hours digital clock. Digital integrated circuits (ICs) allow designers of electrical circuits to implement a wide variety of logical, combinatorial, sequential, and other functions. This lab will be using ICs that contain less than a few hundred transistors each and are called ASICs. SSIC stands for ‘small scale integrated circuits.
We will design a clock using 3, two-digit, common anode “LED seven segment display”, BCD display driver, and cascading counters. The clock will either get a clock signal from the function generator or a timing generator. Then the counters will output 4-bit binary code decimal to display drivers, which will then produce output 7-bit binary output to light up the corresponding digit. A detailed explanation is given under the procedures/technical discerption.
